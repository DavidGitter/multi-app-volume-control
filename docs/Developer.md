## Create a new release
In order to create a new release on GitHub, the project needs some adjustments.

1. The CURRENT_VERSION field in the Form1.cs of the mavc-target-ui-win project needs to be changed to the according (new) version to be released. It is used to check the version of the application against the newest latest version of the GitGub repository in order to decide, if a new version is available and the user needs to be informed or not.

2. Ensure that all modules are build as Release.

3. Then change the the version field of the MavcSetup under MavcSetup>properties aswell as the assambly and file version under mavc-target-win-ui>properties>assembly info.
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This must be done, otherwise the user will get an error later when updating, as the MSI versions do not differ.

4. The actual release consists just of the _MavcSetup.msi_ generated by building MavcSetup modul in the project. In order to create a release the _MavcSetup.msi_ gets zipped and uploaded to GitHub Release and be labeled as latest (if its a main release).
